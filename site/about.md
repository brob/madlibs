# Madlib Generator using 11ty, Sanity, and Netlify

This is a project for a Smashing Magazine article. It uses [11ty's](https://11ty.dev) new serverless mode to serve "server rendered" pages along side build-created pages. It uses [Netlify's](https://netlify.com) On-Demand Builders to cache the resultant user-generated madlibs. The madlib templates and user-generated madlibs are stored in a [Sanity](https://sanity.io/) content lake.

Created by [Bryan Robinson](https://bryanlrobinson.com). The code lives in [GitHub](https://github.com/brob/madlibs) for any additions, tweaks, forking, etc.
